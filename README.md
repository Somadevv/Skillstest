Step 1: Clone the project repository
First, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project on your local machine. Then, clone the repository using the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git

Make sure to replace "yourusername" and "your-project" with the appropriate values for your project.

Step 2: Install dependencies
Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
